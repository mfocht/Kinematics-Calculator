# Kinematics-Calculator
A kinematics calculator for visual basic.

The purpose of this program is to simplify the calculation of kinematics problems.  It saves time, and calculates as many variables as possible with the data given.  The program makes it easier to check kinematics problems, or can even be used as the lone point of calculation for problems where the point not to specifically practice using the equations.  It can reduce the amount of time that is needed to solve many problems, while maintaining an easy to use interface that relies on no other programs, meaning it cannot be broken by an update to chrome or firefox.
